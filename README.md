# MirigosDemo

Demo developed using SpringBoot , java version 8. The services have been created using REST services , JPA - for data/persistence using a derby demo database.

Could be improve by implementing logs, Exception handling could be improve also at service levels and also returning custom messages at the ResponseEntity.
